DbD Live Game Info is a Twitch extension for the game Dead by Daylight. It will show live game info (perks, addons) in an overlayed window. It is written in React + TypeScript. 
It is currently NOT LIVE and you cannot add it. I do not have plans to develop further atm, but I'm leaving it here for anyone who wants inspiration.
